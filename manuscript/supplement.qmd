Examples of some of the taxon groups in Table 1 (main text) to illustrate the body length dimensions associated with different taxa (solid white line in silhouette). This is meant to serve as a rough guide and the body length will differ slightly based on the taxa. All silhouettes were taken from PhyloPic (www.phylopic.org/) barring (e. nauplius), (Wadhwa et al. 2014). Full credit for images are provided in @tbl-s1.

### Testing `InvAlloR` against human experts

We tested whether the `best_fit` workflow led to similar biomass estimates as those based on human experts that selected equations from the literature. For this, we compared 46 dry biomass estimates from 24 species using the `best_fit` workflow with dry biomass estimates from experts who chose length - dry biomass equations based on literature searches (@ogorman2017; Dolmans, unpublished data). We used the same length data for both estimates. This comparison is relevant because choosing equations from the literature is the standard protocol for estimating biomass in freshwater ecology. As previously, we correlated dry biomass estimated from the `best_fit` workflow with dry biomass from expert-chosen equations using a Pearson's correlation coefficient (log10-log10 scale). Dry biomass estimated by `InvAlloR` correlated strongly with the expert-derived dry biomass (Pearson's r = 0.90, CI95%: 0.83 - 0.95, log10-log10 scale) and individual data points generally clustered around the 1:1 line which indicated no systematic over or underestimation (@fig-s2).

The relationship between expert-derived dry biomass (mg, log10) based on literature searches and the estimated dry biomass (mg, log10) from InvTraitR for 46 individuals from 24 species. Data from Dolmans (unpublished) and O'Gorman et al. (2017). The black, dashed line is the 1:1 line. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) on a log10-log10 scale is also shown.
